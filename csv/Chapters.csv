In the 1960s, Willimantic, a borough of Windham, Connecticut planned a project that would devastate it’s downtown area, and would decimate a predominantly Latino neighborhood. 
Known as the “Thread City” for its textile mill industry, the city fell victim to deindustrialization. After decades of economic decline and increasing immigrant populations, the local government finally decided to attempt to revitalize the borough’s central business district to create economic prosperity. However, their efforts at urban renewal didn’t succeed as planned; and consisted of demolishing housing and small businesses to build parking lots and open fields in their place. 
The most obvious remnant left is the creation of Jillson Square Park, which was once three streets, Temple, Center and Broad, zoned for commercial and multi-family residential use. The low-income Puerto Rican families that lived on these blocks were displaced, often with no replacement housing offered to them, and many of their small businesses never recovered. This digital tour will examine other instances and impacts of urban renewal in Willimantic.

During the industrial revolution, cotton, thread, and textile mills emerged on the river banks in Willimantic. As the mill industry grew the borough expanded and developed. In the 1850s and 60s, the mills were operated by Irish immigrants, followed by Eastern European immigrants in the 1900s, and majority Puerto Rican immigrants beginning in the 1950s. Since then, the Puerto Rican population has continued to call Willimantic home despite the decline of the mill industry, which is in part responsible for limited economic prosperity in Willimantic. The first company to use mills in Willimantic was the Willimantic Linemen Company (1854-1898), which was then bought by the English-owned American Thread company, which was the last of mill companies to move down south because of frugality. Currently, former-mills have been repurposed into offices, apartments, artist studios and warehouses as a part of contemporary urban renewal efforts in Willimantic.",18,2,,"411 Main St, Willimantic, CT 06226",41.7109656,-72.2057039,,,,

The success of the Willimantic mill industry was made possible by the nearly one mile stretch in the Willimantic River in which it drops more than 90 feet. Dams were built by mill companies along the river to create enough hydropower to power the massive thread, cotton and textile mills in Willimantic, ultimately creating enough industry to establish the city in the 1820s. However, by the 1950s, mills could be powered in more efficient ways and no longer needed to be near rivers.

For this reason, mill companies built roughly 60 two-family duplexes on Main Street, only a short walk from the mills. This form of housing was called row houses, also known as cookie cutter housing because they all looked identical. Row housing was only available to immigrant mill workers, and rent fees were docked from their wages. To save money, it was extremely popular for immigrant mill working families to live together, which led to the creation of zoning laws against multiple families living in a single apartment. However, in 1938, the American Thread corporation sold the row housing to working and middle class families for nearly $300 each. Soon after, a hurricane destroyed the recently bought houses and they continued to decay from lack of maintenance.",16,4,,"305 Main Street, Willimantic, CT 06226",41.7117779,-72.2042926,,,,

The Prospect Hill Historic District is characterized by its abundance of vintage architecture, more importantly, its Victorian cottages. In the 1880s these Victorian cottages were built by the mill corporations to improve the quality of life of executive mill employees, as well as to attract skilled workers and soothe employee discontent. As Willimantic expanded, the wealthiest residents lived in these Victorian cottages in the Hill District, while impoverished immigrant workers lived close to the factories in unmaintained row housing. For high skilled workers, rents in these Victorian cottages were fixed at 12.5% of the workers’ wages. Housing for migrant workers was not income restricted, and often created a greater rent burden for lower wage employees at the mill. In 1938 the Mills sold these houses, and they deteriorated from lack of maintenance.

The WRA was comprised of five members appointed by the mayor, who were to oversee, make executive decisions, and gather funds for redevelopment initiatives. The WRA also adopted a housing code to create a new standard for housing in Willimantic. The code outlines specific regulations for different aspects of housing like minimum ventilation requirements. However, the housing code was not effectively implemented.

VISTA volunteers serve in the nation’s most impoverished areas and must live in the circumstances of those they serve. It was not uncommon for VISTA volunteers in Willimantic to withdraw from the program because they found life in Willimantic housing unbearable. Roy and Maud Henderson, a retired couple from the Ozark mountains of Arkansas learned about the program from a television ad, applied, trained at headquarters in New Haven and were assigned to serve in Willimantic. The couple was greatly unsatisfied with their housing and after much thought decided to drop the program, explaining, “‘Our quarters in Willimantic were just something we couldn't put up with..our room had a bed, bureau and two straight-backed chairs. We had to share a bath with the whole floor — about 15 rooms.’” VISTA gave the couple each $4 a day for room and board with two meals. But that was not cheap enough to live in a private apartment which led the Hendersons to live in boarding house-style quarters with other Willimantic residents facing the problem of housing insecurity. William R. Olds, director of WACAP explained that the quality of housing for VISTA participants was deficient, but was an honest reflection of the housing instability struggles of impoverished Willimantic families.

This federal program “provides 80 percent of the funds needed for projects while the city pars the remaining 20 percent.” This completion of the application was driven by Mayor Kokoska's and publically well supported.

Lack of “Middle Range” Housing Accessibility & Family Discrimination,https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48366933491_ec904b2eb3.jpg,The Hartford Times,http://www.easternct.edu/connecticutstudies/,"
While affordable housing was being demolished, in 1968 the Hartford reports “A Lack of ‘Middle-Range’ Units is Housing Problem.” A shortage of affordable housing units meant that students from Eastern Connecticut State University and low and moderate families were fighting for the same housing. Rampant housing discrimination means the students were often housed before families. Furthermore, it was more profitable for landlords to convert their buildings into dormitory style-housing with a shared bathroom for the entire floor than to manage a family of tenants in which a higher standard of living is expected and necessary. If families were lucky enough to find affordable housing, it was discovered that they were forced to pay $21 to $37 more per month in rent than non-minority group families. And despite paying more, these families often lived in homes with little to no maintenance. They often experienced a lack of heating, cooling, running water and lighting, improper garbage disposal, peeling paint, and overcrowding because of inaccessibility to affordable housing.

However, in 1971, well after the detrimental effects of urban renewal began to take effect, the proposal for the fair rent commission was dismantled for two reasons. The first was the proposed construction of 175 new housing units on South Street as well as an apartment complex in Windham center, right across the Natchaug River. The hopes were that increased housing options would eliminate rising rent prices. However, there is no record of this housing being built. Additionally, the fair rent ordinance was eliminated when it was learned that a similar commission had already been put in place in Stamford and was met with difficulty because it didn't have the power anticipated and landlords brought cases against them through the Court of Common Pleas. This Stamford commission dissolved, and to avoid wasting time and energy, the local Willimantic government put an end to talks of their creating own commission.",16,26,,"22 South Street, Willimantic, CT 06226
